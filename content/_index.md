MSc in Robotics at TU Delft
{{< /lead >}}

Hello, my name is Andrei-Carlo Papuc. I am a Master’s student at the Department of Cognitive Robotics (CoR) at the Delft University of Technology.

Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology, with a minor in Computational Science and Engineering. 

I am particularly interested in the fields of computer vision, deep learning, planning and decision-making under uncertainty, optimal control, and (reinforcement) learning for control, all within the [realm of robotics](/projects).

Whenever I have the opportunity, I enjoy creating innovative new media art installations that blend engineering with immersive experiences.
