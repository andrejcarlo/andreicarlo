Hello, my name is Andrei-Carlo Papuc. I am a Master’s student at the Department of Cognitive Robotics (CoR) at the Delft University of Technology.

Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology. During my final year, I took my minor in Computational Science and Engineering. My bachelor’s thesis was on the conceptual design of a drone swarm to measure the wind field and temperature stratification in a wind farm.
