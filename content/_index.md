MSc in Robotics at TU Delft
{{< /lead >}}

Hello! My name is Andrei-Carlo Papuc, and I am a Master’s student in the Department of Cognitive Robotics (CoR) at Delft University of Technology.

I am currently working on my thesis in game-theoretical motion planning for autonomous drone racing, supervised by [Javier Alonso-Mora](https://autonomousrobots.nl/), [Lasse Peters](https://lasse-peters.net/), and [Sihao Sun](https://sihaosun.github.io/).

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology, with a minor in Computational Science and Engineering.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of game theory, multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep learning, machine perception, planning under uncertainty, and optimal control—primarily within the exciting field of robotics.

Whenever I have the opportunity, I enjoy creating innovative new media art installations that blend engineering with immersive experiences.
